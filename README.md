# School-Security-System-Using-RFID
Brief Introduction
The project "School Security System using RFID" introduces RFID-based identification and access control to enhance security within school premises while also automating the attendance system.

The outcome of the project is an advanced security system that identifies authorized RFID cards, alerts the security officer about unauthorized access while using the unauthorized RFID card, and automates attendance tracking for students and teachers. The project employs RFID readers, a Firebase real-time database, and RFID-enabled ID cards to achieve its objectives.

The methodology used in this project combines a Procedural approach for design with the flexibility of the incremental software development model. The Procedural approach gives us a well-organized design, while the incremental software development model allows us to adapt and make improvements in an incremental way. This ensures that our project stays organized while also being able to respond to changes effectively.

The project's contribution to enhanced security and automated attendance management is underscored throughout the discussions.

Conclusion
The "RFID School Security System" is a significant advancement in enhancing school safety. RFID technology is employed to identify and manage entries and exits using authorized RFID cards, significantly bolstering security measures, and simplifying attendance tracking. Students and teachers utilize these authorized RFID cards, ensuring a secure and efficient process for entering and leaving the school premises.
The alert system plays a vital role in preventing unauthorized access, promptly notifying security personnel for swift responses to security concerns. Additionally, our project seamlessly integrates with the school's attendance system, automating attendance monitoring for both students and teachers. This not only streamlines administrative tasks but also enhances the accuracy of attendance records.
We've streamlined information management for school staff by organizing student, teacher, and class data. Parents also benefit from accessing real-time attendance records and the capability to request leave for their children. Our emphasis on communication ensures that parents receive automatic notifications in case of their child's absence, fostering collaboration between the school and parents.
It's essential to highlight that our design intentionally omits physical security devices such as metal detectors, concentrating solely on RFID technology for identification and access control. The "RFID School Security System" project successfully accomplishes its objectives of heightening security measures and automating attendance, ultimately creating a safer and more efficient educational environment.
